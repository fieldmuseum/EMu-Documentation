# EMu-Documentation
Field Museum documentation for EMu workflows, structural changes, and standardization.

## Documentation Templates:
One set for each module:

### - [Standards & Workflow Documentation Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L-lFa4STSxdCT8pe1EamQRyEgPI-yjHyAJ2L0id-170/)
We use this to document the discussions and decisions that we make as a user group. Some will lead to structural changes requests and others result in workflow changes. This document stays alive and is intended to be our master documentation for that module.

### - [Structural Changes Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19V6rYzCPe8_u5-JhoCf-sQ0zVDubF9xSHYqApmSaMaA/)
We use this one to document development requests for Axiell. A pdf is created when it is sent to Axiell and the googledoc changes version.

### - [Admin Testing Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16xxeky2kTEMUM4eW1GPQRQFUvvwUsG-gPhuRFNUWUa0/)
We use this document when structural changes are returned to us from Axiell, to document the EMu Admin level review. Once signed off by the Admins it is returned to Axiell.
