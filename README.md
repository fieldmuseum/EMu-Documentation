# EMu-Documentation
Documentation for EMu workflows, structural changes, testing, standardization.

In 2024 we transistioned the majority of the documentation of how use EMu to this repo and now make use of issues, disucssions and the wiki to document as much as possible. We have left these documents here in case anyone wants to use them.

## EMu meetings 
These are now documented in the discussion section of the repo

## Module by module documentation


## Change requests and updates 



## Documentation Templates:

### IN CURRENT USE:
- [Structural Changes Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19V6rYzCPe8_u5-JhoCf-sQ0zVDubF9xSHYqApmSaMaA/)
We use this to document development requests for Axiell. A pdf is created when it is sent to Axiell and the googledoc changes version.

- [Admin Testing Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16xxeky2kTEMUM4eW1GPQRQFUvvwUsG-gPhuRFNUWUa0/)
We use this to document the Admin level review of structural changes as returned to us from Axiell. It indicates whether developments to a module have be completed as specified in the corresponding structural changes document or not. Once signed off by the Admin team it is returned to Axiell.

### DEPRECATED 2024: 
We have transistioned the content and use of these templates to corresponding github wiki pages, issues and documentation

- [Standards & Workflow Documentation Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L-lFa4STSxdCT8pe1EamQRyEgPI-yjHyAJ2L0id-170/)
We use this to document the discussions and decisions that we make as a user group. Some will lead to structural changes requests and others result in workflow changes. This document stays alive and is intended to be our master documentation for that module.  NOTE: Jan 2022. We are currently transitioning this into the wiki section of this repo.
- [User Group Description Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iJ2I_X79dxPpbptJXkG3lYbekszdSqJL5P5yLTYly_o/)
We use this to document the creaton of a user group and the registry entries that are necessary to define it. 
- - [accompanying request guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K-kkldur2nQ4umQsbCT7DSPKiyZ9bquaXsC8ngLay98/) 
This is for power users when they want a new group created.
