# EMu-Documentation
Documentation for EMu workflows, structural changes, testing, standardization.

In 2024 we transistioned the majority of the documentation of how use EMu to this repo and now make use of issues, disucssions and the wiki to document as much as possible. We have left these documents here in case anyone wants to use them.

## Discussions
EMu meetings are now documented in the [discussion section](https://github.com/fieldmuseum/EMu-Documentation/discussions) of the repo. Each is tagged according the the user departnent, and module. The discussions are divided into the following types:
### EMu in the News
  These discussions are fun mentions of EMu's in the news and can be from anyone.
### FAQs
  These discussions are answers to questions that crop up on a regular basis. The answers are generally short and the fixes stable.
### HOW TO's...
  These discussions are answers to questions that mostly relate to workflows and broader topics than covered by an FAQ. The answers are generally complex and often have accompanying documents and spreadsheets.
### MEETINGS
  These discussions are the metting notes for open meetings of the Field Museum EMu community. These include regularly scheduled EMu hour, EMu User meetings, module working group meetings and ad-hoc topic sessions. Each meeting my generation questions and these (with their answers) are documented as Q&A discussions.
### Q&A's
  Any member of the EMu community can submit a non-urgent question to a meeting. Each of these has its own discussion item which is (as far as possible) answered at the meeting. If it cannot be answered fully then the user may be asked to create an IT helpdesk ticket and/or a github issue for tracking of any investigations and solutions to the question. 
### Relevant Reading
  These discussions are used to docunent any data releated reading that users which to share with each other.
### Report Requests and Updates
  If a user wants a non-urgent report created or updated a discussion may be created, particularly if it is a cross-departmental shared report.
### Structural Changes
  There is one structural changes disucssion for each EMu module. If any discussion leads to a request by a user or group to change or add new functionality to EMu (that is not urgetn) then a comment it added for that module. These comments are then held until the next round of funded structurak changes is submitted to Axiel for development.

## Module by module documentation
Each module has a set of wiki pages that documents the use of that module at the Museum. This is where we document any standards are agreed by the respect working groups.

## Change requests and updates 



## Documentation Templates:

### IN CURRENT USE:
- [Structural Changes Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19V6rYzCPe8_u5-JhoCf-sQ0zVDubF9xSHYqApmSaMaA/)
We use this to document development requests for Axiell. A pdf is created when it is sent to Axiell and the googledoc changes version.

- [Admin Testing Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16xxeky2kTEMUM4eW1GPQRQFUvvwUsG-gPhuRFNUWUa0/)
We use this to document the Admin level review of structural changes as returned to us from Axiell. It indicates whether developments to a module have be completed as specified in the corresponding structural changes document or not. Once signed off by the Admin team it is returned to Axiell.

### DEPRECATED 2024: 
We have transistioned the content and use of these templates to corresponding github wiki pages, issues and documentation

- [Standards & Workflow Documentation Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L-lFa4STSxdCT8pe1EamQRyEgPI-yjHyAJ2L0id-170/)
We use this to document the discussions and decisions that we make as a user group. Some will lead to structural changes requests and others result in workflow changes. This document stays alive and is intended to be our master documentation for that module.  NOTE: Jan 2022. We are currently transitioning this into the wiki section of this repo.
- [User Group Description Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iJ2I_X79dxPpbptJXkG3lYbekszdSqJL5P5yLTYly_o/)
We use this to document the creaton of a user group and the registry entries that are necessary to define it. 
- - [accompanying request guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K-kkldur2nQ4umQsbCT7DSPKiyZ9bquaXsC8ngLay98/) 
This is for power users when they want a new group created.
