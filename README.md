# EMu-Documentation
Field Museum documentation for EMu workflows, structural changes, and standardization.

## Documentation Templates:
One set for each module:

### - [Standards & Workflow Documentation Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L-lFa4STSxdCT8pe1EamQRyEgPI-yjHyAJ2L0id-170/)
We use this to document the discussions and decisions that we make as a user group. Some will lead to structural changes requests and others result in workflow changes. This document stays alive and is intended to be our master documentation for that module.

### - [Structural Changes Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19V6rYzCPe8_u5-JhoCf-sQ0zVDubF9xSHYqApmSaMaA/)
We use this to document development requests for Axiell. A pdf is created when it is sent to Axiell and the googledoc changes version.

### - [Admin Testing Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16xxeky2kTEMUM4eW1GPQRQFUvvwUsG-gPhuRFNUWUa0/)
We use this to document the Admin level review of structural changes as returned to us from Axiell. It indicates whether developments to a module have be completed as specified in the corresponding structural changes document or not. Once signed off by the Admin team it is returned to Axiell.

## Project Workflows and Procedure Documents:

### - [oVert - 3D data and MorphoSource](https://github.com/fieldmuseum/EMu-Documentation/blob/master/oVert_FMNH_EMu_Data_WorkflowApril2020.pdf)
This is the EMu assets archiving workflow for the oVert Project (April 2020). It's aim is to create 3D scans of vertebrate taxa and uses the MorphosOurce platform as the primary host and discovery platform for the media. Master copies are archived in EMu as emultimedia records.
