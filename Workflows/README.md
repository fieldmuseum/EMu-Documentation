# EMu Workflow Documentation

## Multimedia
- **3D media workflows** follow steps to line up multimedia and associated metadata with [Audubon Core standards](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/tree/master/3d). 
Currently, we have workflows for the following 3D scanning modalities & media-types:
  - [CT scans]()
  - [Photogrammetry image sets]()
  - [3D models]() (e.g., in PLY & OBJ formats)
